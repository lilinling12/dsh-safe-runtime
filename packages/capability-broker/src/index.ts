/**
 * Capability Broker public package surface.
 *
 * M4-010 through M4-014 classifier/fallback stages and M4-020 through M4-022
 * prerequisites are governance-closed. M4-023 deterministic approval routing is
 * implementation-accepted after exact-head dual-green protocol-first and
 * implementation Gates; final governance closure remains separate.
 *
 * Approval routing is not a durable CapabilityDecision or execution authority.
 * Lease lifecycle/consume, decision receipts, guarantees and PEP enforcement
 * remain later Gates.
 *
 * Protocol capability names remain owned by `@dsh-safe/protocol`; this package
 * has no concrete DeepSeek Harness runtime dependency.
