/**
 * Capability Broker public package surface.
 *
 * M4-010 through M4-014 classifier/fallback stages and M4-020 through M4-025
 * PDP / Decision-Receipt / GuaranteeLevel prerequisites are governance-closed.
 * M4-030 deterministic CapabilityLease TTL validity is governance-closed.
 * M4-031 deterministic CapabilityLease usage validity is now implemented for
 * exact-head verification; package-stage acceptance is intentionally unchanged.
 *
 * M4-031 evaluates only the current maxUses/remainingUses snapshot. It does not
 * reserve or consume usage, check TTL/revocation/delegation, bypass approval,
 * execute actions, or wire a PEP. Atomic consume remains M4-032.
 *
 * Protocol capability/Decision/Receipt/Lease types remain owned by
 * `@dsh-safe/protocol`; this package has no concrete DeepSeek Harness runtime
 * dependency.
